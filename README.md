# Audio/Video App

 An audio / video app built using queries and database assets.  A user is able to log in, filter and select a movie, tv show or audio to stream based on decade/era.  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need Git.
[See detailed install instructions here.](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

### Installing

From terminal:

```# Initialize git

$ git init

# Clone this repository

$ git clone https://github.com/shadiaali/Ali_S_AV_App.git

# Go into the repository

$ cd Ali_S_AV_App.git

```

Open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd Ali_S_AV_App
npm install
```

Finally, run `gulp` to run the Sass compiler. Don't forget to import to a new database called `db_av_app`.
